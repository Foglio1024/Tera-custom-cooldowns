TCC is a material design-like style replacement for some of the TERA Online UI elements.
The application is still in early stage of development, there are bugs and there may be performance issues.

## **It's strongly suggested to install TCC as a TERA Toolbox module using Get More Mods tab.**

### Standalone version [download](https://github.com/Foglio1024/Tera-custom-cooldowns/releases) (not recommended)
